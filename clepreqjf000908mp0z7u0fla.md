Not very long ago, a man with **undefined** future dealing with too many unexpected **closures** in his life was often seen making **promises** behind the scenes. Even though the **promises** he made were **void,** that they would just **resolve** to nothing, yet he would **await** their **responses** forever. How could he know that he would be betrayed? It would seem like there were no **errors** in his **methods** to other **listeners,** and that he was **function**ing as expected. But, how could they understand his inner pain by just listening to **external events?** How could they fathom that it was slowly getting out of his **scope** without him realizing it? How could they possibly understand his pain of figuring out the **return values** in his life from **deeply nested functions** that he performed daily? The agony of trying to **iterate** through all the beliefs only to realize later that they are **empty** is a burden that only he can bear.

Even in his home, devoid of any kind of proper treatment, he often tried to squash the **bugs,** alone. In the middle of the night, he stared at the gloomy moon wishing the **union** with the girl of his dreams. Had he got the chance to **interface** with this girl that he wished for regularly, more than half of his **recursive** problems would be solved. However, he was afraid to ask her out. What if she said, “You are not my **type**”, or something like “ You do not have what is necessary to **implement** my demand”. He often tried to **record** these feelings, but he didn’t have the means to do so. With their clumsy ways, his neighbors used to **extend** their sympathy towards him, but where was he bellowing from? They could **never** know. Afraid of **null and unknown,** he couldn’t **assert** what is right and what is wrong. He tried to **narrow** down his **infinite** problems to a small **set** of **objects**, but just by **prototyping** the solution (that’s all he could do), he realized that he hadn’t **inherited** the will to move toward the future.

He tried to **switch** his poor mentality to **higher order** and **level** to achieve **safety** and peace of mind, but he couldn’t due to his highly **dynamic** mind leading to overthinking and depression. Slowly, he withered away, unable to **generalize** the solution to his problem.

P.S: How was the story? JavaScript is an amazing programming language with a never-ending learning process, but Typescript makes it even better. I used keywords of JavaScript and Typescript as much as I could to make it fun. Do share it with your friends and upvote it if you like it!
